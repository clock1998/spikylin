# Garage Shelf

## Requirements

My garage is a mess, so I need a shelf to store some of the tools and other stuff. The shelf should be able to hold at least 100kg per step, and be deep enough to hold tires, big traval case, camping equipements, and storage case.

## Design

The shelf is 1.824 m wide, 0.6m deep, and 2m tall. The heigh for each level is 0.576m. The shelf is made of 2x4s and plywood.
The design is optimized for material usage and cost. The total cost is around 70 CAD at the time of writing. All you need is 14 peices of 2x4x8', 2 peices of 4x8' plywood, and some screws.

## Build

You will need the following tools:

- Circular saw
- Drill
- Screwdriver
- Measuring tape
- Square
- Level

I made the shelfs first. The joints are made with screws.
I then made the verticals. Note that the verticals are made of 1 2x4s and 3 small pieces of wood. The shelf will act as a drawer when you assemble the shelf. 
The three smaller peices of wood are attached to the 2x4s with screws and glue.

The build is pretty simple, just follow the design and you will be fine. 
The only thing to note is that the plywood is not attached to the 2x4s, it is just placed on top of the 2x4s, and fixed to the cut at each end of the board. This is to allow for easy replacement of the plywood in the future.

## Future Improvements

I would not use only screws to join all the 2x4s. I will make a proper joints or Simpson Strong Tie in the future. Without much experience, it is hard to make all the joints straight and leveled, thus leads to woobly shelf in the end.
